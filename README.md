# Statistical Considerations Concerning Graphology and Medical Applications

## Introduction

This repository hosts my first paper on graphology, written during the COVID-19 pandemic (when I was a still a high school student) as an exploratory project to apply statistical methods to handwriting analysis. The study is an amateur attempt at integrating mathematical models with graphology, a traditionally subjective field, and is certainly open to further refinement and expansion.
The project started as a fun experiment but ended up reaching very interesting results which were appreciated and published by Cigme (Centro Internazionale Grafologia Medica)

## Project Overview

The paper examines the use of statistical tools to support graphologists in evaluating handwriting. It explores both authorship determination through probabilistic analysis and medical applications, particularly in diagnosing dysgraphia and chronic vascular encephalopathy (CVE). By quantifying handwriting characteristics, the paper aims to bring more objectivity in this field.

## Contents

- **Authorship Analysis**: A framework that uses Gaussian curves to attribute handwriting based on measurable traits, providing a percentage-based probability of authorship.
- **Medical Applications**: Tools and parameters for assessing handwriting characteristics linked to dysgraphia in children and handwriting deterioration in CVE patients, drawing analogies between the two.

## Future Improvements

While this project lays a foundation, future studies could:
- Enhance the statistical models for greater precision.
- Expand the range of graphological parameters and testing data.
- Integrate machine learning techniques for automated handwriting assessment (very very useful).
